                    <h3>What is javascript?</h3>
                    <p>
                        javascript is a high-level , interpreted programming language.
                         It executes line by line that's why this is called <span>singles threaded language</span>.
                         It will do run time assignments.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is a variable?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum or
                         a string that we might use as a part of a sentence.
                         <p>They are 3 types..</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Var</li>
                            <li>Let</li>
                            <li>Const</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Declaration</h3>
                                <p>It refers to the process of introducing a variable to the JS interpreter</p>
                                <p>It involves specifying the variable name using a keyword like 'var', 'let' and 'const'</p>
                                <p>Ex: 
                                    <p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>var x;</li>
                                        <li>let y;</li>
                                        <li>const z;</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h3>Initialization</h3>
                                <p>It is the process of giving an value to a variable at the time of declaration or later in the program</p>
                                <p>Variable can be declared without being initialized. In such cases, they hold <span>Undefined</span> value until a value is assign to them. </p>
                                <p>EX:</p>
                                <p>var x = 5; Declaration & Initialization</p>
                                <p>let y; Declaration</p>
                                <p>y=6; Initialization</p>
                                <p>Const = "Hello" (const variables must be initialized when declared)</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h3>Assignment</h3>
                                <p>It involves updating the value of an already declared variable</p>
                                <p>Ex:</p>
                                <p>var x = 5;</p>
                                <p>x = 10;</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h3>Hoisting</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Hoisting means that variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase,
                                    while the assignments (Initializations) remains in place.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                       
                </div>

                <div style="display: none;" id="topic-3" class="row-var">
                    <h3>What is var key word in javascript?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The var key word is used to declare variables.
                        It was the original way to declare variables in JS before 
                        the introduction of "let" and "const" in ECMAScript(ES6)

                        <p>var x = 5;</p>

                        Variable declare with var are function-scoped or globally scoped, which 
                        means they are accessible within the function or globally if declare outside of any function.
                        <p>One important characterstic of var-decalared variable is that they have "Hoisting" behavior. 
                            This means that variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase </p> 
                    </p>

                    <p>Datatypes are two types</p>
                    <p>Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we're gonna be working with and storing in variables</p>
